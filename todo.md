# TPIVOT TODO

## Functionality 
- New functionality
    - GROUP BY DATE 
        - Did greg just add this as a column?
        - for date types -> Year, Month, Day, Hour
    - implement filters
    - Returning error messages from pivot parsing?
    - Server retuning metadata such as selected row fields?
    - What should happen when the user picks an invalid field (this can happen if col type is CLOB)?

## Presentation

- Can we use the jquery pivot table library's HTML table construction functions to make our new table look good?
- The list of tables is too long. Have to scroll to get to query box. Should there be either:
    - side-by-side view?
    - 2-column layout for long field lists?
- Need total rows/cols.
